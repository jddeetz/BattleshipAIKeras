# BattleshipAIKeras
Implementing Keras to play Battleship, the board game.

To use this repo, you must have the following modules installed:
1) Keras, 2.x - This runs the AI for the game
2) Pickle - This stores the model for the AI, as well as some of the game boards

To play the game, you only need to clone the repo and run the Battleship.py script.

Enjoy!
